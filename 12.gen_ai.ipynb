It spans across nine countries, including Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. The rainforest is home to around 10% of the known species on Earth, including jaguars, sloths, and thousands of species of insects and birds.\n",

      "Cosine Similarity A: Deforestation is a significant threat to the Amazon, with thousands of square kilometers lost each year due to agriculture, logging, and urbanization. This deforestation contributes to climate change, as the rainforest acts as a major carbon sink, absorbing millions of tons of carbon dioxide annually.\n",

      "Q: How does the Amazon rainforest affect global weather patterns?\n",
      "Cosine Similarity A: Scientists believe that the Amazon plays a crucial role in global weather patterns by releasing water vapor into the atmosphere, which influences rainfall across South America and even other continents. The Amazon River, which flows through the rainforest, is the second longest river in the world and carries more water than any other river.\n",
